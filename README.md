Project: Is A “Centre-Forward” Footballer’s Market Value Determined only by Their Statistics?:
    
    Problem Area: In professional football, there's ongoing debate about how a player's market value is determined, especially for "Centre-Forwards." This study uses data from the "Most Expensive Footballers 2021" dataset, which considers various factors like a player's performance and the league's competitiveness. We'll analyze the top 50 "Centre-Forwards" to assess how goals and assists significantly impact their market value.

    Methodology: This project shows a range of data analyst skills and data-driven techniques while using essential Python libraries. First, for data collection, the "Most Expensive Footballers 2021" dataset was sourced from Kaggle. Following this rigorous data cleaning was done to ensure data integrity and consistency. Notably, during this process, a few data columns were combined to create the "Goals + Assists per match" column, a key player performance metric. Python served as the primary programming language, with essential libraries such as pandas for adept data manipulation, and numpy for precise numerical operations. K-means clustering and Linear Regression were the two Machine learning techniques that were then deployed to model and evaluate the intricate relationship between market value and performance statistics. Where for linear Regression the the data set was spilt to create training data, to create a model, and test data to compare it against the model. To further strengthen the analysis, data visualization was carried out with Python using matplotlib to present clear and informative visualisations and the pd.set_option for fine-tuning the display options.

    Findings: The project's findings revealed that player performance statistics significantly affect the market values of footballers who were valued below £60 million, while higher-valued players above £130 million are influenced by a broader range of factors beyond statistics, such as age, league, and playing style. K-Means clustering provided additional insights by demonstrating that players with higher performance statistics tend to be valued more in the lower price range. The linear regression analysis indicates a small positive correlation (R-Value of 0.24308) between market value and player performance statistics, although the model's fit was poor, suggesting a more complex relationship. In summary, while statistics play a role in determining market values, their impact varies depending on a player's value range, highlighting the complex nature of football player valuation.
