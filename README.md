Project: Is A “Centre-Forward” Footballer’s Market Value Determined only by Their Statistics?:
    
    Problem Area: In professional football, there's ongoing debate about how a player's market value is determined, especially for "Centre-Forwards." This study uses data from the "Most Expensive Footballers 2021" dataset, which considers various factors like a player's performance and the league's competitiveness. We'll analyze the top 50 "Centre-Forwards" to assess how goals and assists significantly impact their market value.
