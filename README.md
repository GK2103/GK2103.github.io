#### Project: Is A “Centre-Forward” Footballer’s Market Value Determined only by Their Statistics?:
    
##### Problem Area: 
In professional football, there's ongoing debate about how a player's market value is determined, especially for "Centre-Forwards." This study uses data from the "Most Expensive Footballers 2021" dataset, which considers various factors like a player's performance and the league's competitiveness. We'll analyse the top 50 "Centre-Forwards" to assess how goals and assists significantly impact their market value.

##### Methodology: 
This project shows a range of data analyst skills and data-driven techniques while using essential Python libraries. 

• First, for data collection, I had sourced the "Most Expensive Footballers 2021" dataset from Kaggle. 

• Following this I had done rigorous data cleaning to ensure data integrity and consistency. Notably, during this process, I had combined a few data columns to create the "Goals + Assists per match" column, a key player performance metric. 

• Python served as the primary programming language, with essential libraries such as pandas for adept data manipulation, and numpy for precise numerical operations. 

• K-means clustering and Linear Regression were the two Machine learning techniques that were then deployed to model and evaluate the intricate relationship between market value and performance statistics. Where for linear Regression the the data set was spilt to create training data, to create a model, and test data to compare it against the model. 

• To further strengthen the analysis, I had done some data visualization with Python using matplotlib to present clear and informative visualisations and the pd.set_option for fine-tuning the display options.

##### Findings: (Full analysis can be found in the Project PDF) 
The project's findings revealed that player performance statistics significantly affect the market values of footballers who were valued below £60 million, while higher-valued players above £130 million are influenced by a broader range of factors beyond statistics, such as age, league, and playing style. K-Means clustering provided additional insights by demonstrating that players with higher performance statistics tend to be valued more in the lower price range. The linear regression analysis indicates a small positive correlation (R-Value of 0.243) (Table 3) between market value and player performance statistics, although the model's fit was poor, as seen in Graph 2, suggesting a more complex relationship. In summary, while statistics play a role in determining market values, their impact varies depending on a player's value range, highlighting the complex nature of football player valuation.

#### Project: WeightLess Fitness App:

##### Problem Area: 

This project aims to tackle the global obesity crisis as it been reported by EASO that obesity and being overweight is the 5th global cause of death (EASO, 2020). Despite abundant online information, misinformation and lack of motivation and engaging solutions hinder effective weight loss (Nakul, 2022).

##### Methodology: 

The project introduces a mobile fitness app with educational features, goal setting, and tracking, as upon research they had shown promising user engagement results (Consagoustech, 2023). By offering a reliable and engaging solution, "WeightLess" strives to combat global obesity. The App was implemented using Android Studios where XML was used for the Front End. The Backend used was mainly java for the functionality of the app and SQL for the database.

Weight Less included many features: 

-	Calorie Tracker – A feature used to track the daily calorie intake of the user, the details of which the user enters manually. The entry is stored in a separate SQLite database and displayed back to the user to see their progress.  

-	Workout Tracker - A feature used to track the Workout the user has done, the details of which the user enters manually. The entry is stored in a separate SQLite database and displayed back to the user to see their progress.  

-	Information Station – A feature aimed to educate the user on sustainable WeightLoss, Workout Routines and Meal plans.
  
-	Calorie Goal Calculator – A feature that calculates a user’s caloric goal based on their biometric data.


##### Implementation: 
Both tracking features worked by using a SQLite Database and writing SQL queries using both Java and SQL to write values into the database and then displaying this back to the user in an appealing format as well as changing and deleting pre-existing data/Enteries made.
